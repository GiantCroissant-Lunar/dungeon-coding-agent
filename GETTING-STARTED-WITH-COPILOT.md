# ðŸš€ Getting Started with GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

## ðŸ“‹ How to Assign RFCs to Copilot

### **Step 1: Create Issues for RFCs**

You have two options:

#### **Option A: Automated (Recommended)**
Use the provided script to create all RFC issues at once:

```bash
# Using bash (Linux/Mac/WSL)
./create-rfc-issues.sh

# Using PowerShell (Windows)
.\create-rfc-issues.ps1
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
- Authenticate: `gh auth login`
- Push repository to GitHub first

#### **Option B: Manual**
For each RFC you want Copilot to implement:

1. **Go to GitHub Issues** â†’ "New Issue"
2. **Select "RFC Implementation" template**
3. **Fill out the template:**
   - Replace `[RFC Number and Title]` with actual RFC (e.g., "RFC001: Core Game Loop")
   - Replace `[X days]` with estimated effort from RFC
   - Add link to specific RFC file
4. **Create the issue**

### **Step 2: Run the Workflow (Alternative)**

Instead of using scripts, you can trigger the GitHub Actions workflow:

1. **Go to Actions tab** in your GitHub repository
2. **Select "Create RFC Issues for Copilot"** workflow  
3. **Click "Run workflow"** â†’ select options â†’ **Run workflow**
4. **Wait for completion** - all 9 RFC issues will be created automatically

### **Step 3: Assign Issue to Copilot**

1. **Open the created issue**
2. **Click "Assignees" on the right sidebar**
3. **Assign to Copilot** (the exact process may vary by GitHub plan)
4. **Add @copilot mention** in a comment: "@copilot Please implement this RFC according to the specification"

### **Step 4: Monitor Progress**

- **Copilot creates feature branch** (e.g., `feature/rfc001-core-game-loop`)
- **Copilot creates draft pull request** when implementation is ready
- **Review the pull request** and provide feedback in comments
- **Copilot iterates** based on your feedback
- **Merge when satisfied** with implementation and tests

### **Step 5: Setup Fully Automated Workflow**

Enable complete agent-to-agent automation (no human intervention needed):

1. **Go to Actions tab** â†’ **Run "Setup Automated Merge Environment"** workflow
2. This configures the repository for **fully automated agent workflow**
3. **Agents handle everything** - implementation, review, merge, and issue closure

## ðŸ¤– Fully Automated Agent Workflow

Once set up, the complete automation works like this:

### **Implementation Agent (Copilot)**:
1. **Creates feature branch** (e.g., `feature/rfc001-core-game-loop`)
2. **Implements RFC** according to specification 
3. **Writes comprehensive tests** (>80% coverage requirement)
4. **Updates RFC status** from Draft â†’ In Progress â†’ Complete
5. **Opens pull request** with detailed implementation description

### **Coordination Agent (Automated)**:
1. **Automatically reviews PR** when opened:
   - âœ… Verifies build succeeds
   - âœ… Confirms all tests pass
   - âœ… Checks RFC completion (>80% criteria)
   - âœ… Analyzes code quality (>70/100 score)
2. **Auto-approves** if all criteria met
3. **Auto-merges** to main branch using squash merge
4. **Closes RFC issue** automatically
5. **Posts completion status** and readiness for next RFC

### **If Issues Found**:
- **Coordination Agent** requests changes with specific feedback
- **Implementation Agent** can iterate and fix issues
- **Process repeats** until quality criteria are met
- **Full automation** - no human intervention required

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Starting Issues

### **Start with Foundation (Can work in parallel):**

**Issue 1: Core Game Loop**
```
Title: Implement RFC001: Core Game Loop & State Management
Body: Implement the game engine, turn management, and ECS world according to docs/RFC/RFC001-Core-Game-Loop.md
```

**Issue 2: Terminal Application Shell**  
```
Title: Implement RFC002: Terminal.Gui Application Shell
Body: Implement the Terminal.Gui framework and main application window according to docs/RFC/RFC002-Terminal-Application-Shell.md
```

### **Then Core Gameplay:**

**Issue 3: Map System**
```
Title: Implement RFC003: Map Generation & Rendering System  
Body: Implement dungeon generation and map rendering according to docs/RFC/RFC003-Map-Generation-System.md
Dependencies: Requires RFC001 and RFC002 to be completed first
```

**Issue 4: Player Movement**
```
Title: Implement RFC004: Player Entity & Movement System
Body: Implement player entity and movement mechanics according to docs/RFC/RFC004-Player-Movement-System.md  
Dependencies: Requires RFC001 and RFC003 to be completed first
```

## ðŸ¤– Example Issue Creation

Here's exactly what to do for the first RFC:

1. **Go to**: `https://github.com/[your-username]/dungeon-coding-agent/issues/new`
2. **Select**: "RFC Implementation" template
3. **Title**: `Implement RFC001: Core Game Loop & State Management`
4. **Body**: Fill out the template with:
   - **RFC**: RFC001: Core Game Loop & State Management
   - **File**: `docs/RFC/RFC001-Core-Game-Loop.md` 
   - **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
   - **Dependencies**: None (foundational system)
5. **Labels**: `rfc-implementation`, `copilot` (should auto-add)
6. **Create Issue**
7. **Assign to Copilot**
8. **Comment**: "@copilot This RFC is ready for implementation. Please review the specification and implement the core game loop system."

## ðŸ“‹ Issue Management

### **Track Progress:**
- Use issue labels to track status: `in-progress`, `needs-review`, `completed`
- Monitor pull requests created by Copilot
- Provide feedback through PR comments

### **Quality Control:**
- Review all Copilot pull requests before merging
- Test the implementation against RFC acceptance criteria
- Ensure code follows project standards from `AGENTS.md`

### **Multiple Agents:**
- Create separate issues for each RFC
- Copilot can work on multiple issues simultaneously
- Dependencies are clearly marked in each issue

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

You'll know the experiment is working when:
- [ ] Copilot creates pull requests for assigned RFCs
- [ ] Implementations pass the acceptance criteria tests
- [ ] Multiple RFCs can be worked on in parallel
- [ ] Final result is a playable dungeon crawler game
- [ ] Code quality meets project standards

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**If Copilot doesn't respond:**
- Ensure GitHub Copilot Coding Agent is enabled for your account/organization
- Check that you have the correct GitHub Copilot plan (Pro, Pro+, Business, Enterprise)
- Try mentioning @copilot in a comment with clear instructions

**If implementation quality is poor:**
- Provide specific feedback in pull request comments
- Reference the RFC specification and acceptance criteria
- Ask Copilot to review the `AGENTS.md` coding guidelines

## ðŸŽ® Ready to Start?

1. **Push this repository to GitHub** (make it public)
2. **Enable GitHub Copilot Coding Agent** in repository settings
3. **Create your first issue** using RFC001
4. **Assign to Copilot** and watch the magic happen!

The goal is to see multiple Copilot agents implementing different RFCs in parallel, ultimately creating a complete rogue-like dungeon crawler game.
