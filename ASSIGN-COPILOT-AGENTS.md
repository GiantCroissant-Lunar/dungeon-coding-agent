# 🤖 How to Assign GitHub Copilot Agents to RFCs

## Current RFC Issues Ready for Assignment

Run this command to see all RFC issues:
```bash
gh issue list --label="" --state=open
```

## Step-by-Step Assignment Process

### **Option 1: Via GitHub Web UI**
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/[your-username]/dungeon-coding-agent/issues
2. **Click on an RFC issue** (e.g., "Implement RFC001: Core Game Loop")
3. **Click "Assignees"** on the right sidebar
4. **Assign to Copilot** (if available in your GitHub plan)
5. **Add a comment**: `@copilot Please implement this RFC according to the specification in docs/RFC/RFC001-Core-Game-Loop.md`

### **Option 2: Via Command Line (If Copilot CLI Available)**
```bash
# Assign RFC001 to Copilot
gh issue edit 3 --add-assignee copilot

# Add implementation request comment
gh issue comment 3 --body "@copilot Please implement RFC001: Core Game Loop according to the specification in docs/RFC/RFC001-Core-Game-Loop.md. Create a feature branch and implement with comprehensive tests."
```

### **Option 3: Batch Assignment Script**
```bash
# Create a script to assign all RFCs (if you have multiple Copilot seats)
for issue_id in 3 4 5; do
  gh issue comment $issue_id --body "@copilot Please implement this RFC according to the specification. Create feature branch, implement with tests, and open PR when ready."
done
```

## 🎯 Recommended Starting Order

### **Start with Foundation (Parallel Implementation)**
1. **RFC001**: Core Game Loop & State Management (Issue #3)
2. **RFC002**: Terminal.Gui Application Shell (Issue #4)

These can be implemented in parallel as they have minimal dependencies.

### **Then Build Upon Foundation**
3. **RFC003**: Map Generation System (requires RFC001)
4. **RFC004**: Player Movement System (requires RFC001 + RFC003)
5. **RFC005**: Combat System (requires RFC001 + RFC004)

## 🔍 How to Monitor Agent Progress

### **Check for Feature Branches**
```bash
# Look for feature branches created by Copilot
git branch -r | grep feature/rfc
```

### **Monitor Pull Requests**
```bash
# Check for PRs created by Copilot
gh pr list --author=copilot
```

### **Watch Issue Activity**
```bash
# Monitor issue comments and status changes
gh issue view 3 --comments
```

## 🚨 Signs That Copilot is Working

### **✅ Agent Started Implementation**
- Feature branch created (e.g., `feature/rfc001-core-game-loop`)
- Initial commits appear on the branch
- RFC status updated from "📝 Draft" to "🔄 In Progress"

### **✅ Agent Implementation Complete**
- Draft pull request created
- All acceptance criteria addressed
- Tests implemented and passing
- RFC marked as complete in PR description

### **✅ Automated Review Process**
- Coordination agent reviews PR automatically
- Build and test status checks run
- Auto-merge occurs if all criteria met

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If Copilot Doesn't Respond**
1. **Check GitHub Plan**: Ensure you have GitHub Copilot with Coding Agent features
2. **Verify Assignment**: Make sure Copilot is actually assigned to the issue
3. **Clear Instructions**: Use explicit @copilot mentions with clear instructions
4. **Repository Access**: Ensure Copilot has access to your repository

### **If Implementation Stalls**
1. **Provide Feedback**: Comment on the PR with specific guidance
2. **Reference Specs**: Point Copilot to specific RFC sections
3. **Break Down Tasks**: Create sub-issues for complex RFCs

### **If Auto-Merge Fails**
1. **Check Build Status**: Ensure all tests pass
2. **Review Code Quality**: Verify code meets quality thresholds
3. **RFC Completion**: Confirm >80% acceptance criteria completed

## 📊 Expected Timeline

### **Per RFC (Estimated)**
- **Setup Time**: 5-10 minutes (feature branch, initial commits)
- **Implementation**: 2-6 hours (depending on RFC complexity)
- **Testing**: 1-2 hours (unit tests and integration tests)
- **PR Creation**: 5-10 minutes (automated by agent)
- **Review & Merge**: 5-10 minutes (automated by coordination agent)

### **Full Project (All 9 RFCs)**
- **Sequential**: 2-3 weeks
- **Parallel** (3-4 agents): 1 week
- **Fully Automated**: Minimal human intervention required

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Assign RFC001 and RFC002** to Copilot agents (these can run in parallel)
2. **Monitor progress** via branches and PRs
3. **Let automation handle** the rest - coordination agent will manage merges
4. **Assign subsequent RFCs** once dependencies are completed

The goal is complete automation from RFC assignment to merged implementation! 🎉
