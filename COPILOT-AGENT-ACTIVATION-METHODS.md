# ü§ñ GitHub Copilot Agent Activation Methods

## üéØ Overview

This document details the **proven methods** for activating GitHub Copilot coding agents to work on issues and PRs, discovered through testing in the dungeon-coding-agent project.

## ‚úÖ Proven Activation Methods

### **Method 1: Issue Body @copilot Mention** ‚≠ê **MOST RELIABLE**

**Status**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED WORKING** - Successfully created PR #7 automatically (August 30, 2025)

#### **The Key Discovery**
The most reliable activation method is to include `@copilot` mention **directly in the issue body/description** when creating or editing the issue.

#### **For New Issues**
```markdown
This issue tracks implementation of [RFC].

- RFC document: [link to RFC]
- Labels: rfc-implementation, agent-work, ai-review-requested

Acceptance Criteria:
- Satisfy all RFC acceptance criteria
- Tests implemented and passing
- Integrates with existing systems as specified

**@copilot Please implement the [RFC] [System Name] as specified in the RFC document. This system handles [brief description of functionality].**
```

#### **For Existing Issues (Edit Body)**
Add to the bottom of existing issue body:
```markdown
**@copilot Please implement the [RFC] [System Name] as specified in the RFC document. [Brief context about what the system does].**
```

#### **Success Evidence**
- **Issue #54 (RFC001)**: Had `@copilot` in body ‚Üí **PR #7 created automatically** on 2025-08-30T14:40:59Z
- **GitHub Actions run 17345064609**: Copilot agent worked for 13m3s and completed successfully
- **Issues #29, #30, #31**: Updated with `@copilot` mentions on 2025-09-01T06:20+ (monitoring for results)

### **Method 2: Comment-Based Activation** ‚ö†Ô∏è **LIMITED EFFECTIVENESS**

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY WORKING** - Works for PR reactivation, inconsistent for issue activation

#### **For PRs (Reactivation)** ‚úÖ **RELIABLE**
```markdown
@copilot This PR has been stale for [time period] with [specific issues] remaining. 

Can you help complete this [RFC/feature] implementation by fixing the remaining [specific problems]?

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ [completed work]
- ‚ùå [remaining issues]

## Specific Issues to Fix
- [bullet point list of specific problems]

Please continue from where you left off and get this PR ready for merge.
```

#### **For Issues** ‚ùå **UNRELIABLE** 
Comments with `@copilot` mentions on issues do **NOT** reliably trigger new agent work. They may trigger workflow runs but don't create new PRs.

#### **Evidence**
- **PR #8 (RFC002 Terminal.Gui)**: ‚úÖ Reactivated via comment ‚Üí GitHub Actions run `17368841723` 
- **Issues #29, #30, #31**: ‚ùå Comments failed to create new PRs (only triggered labeling workflows)

### **Method 3: GitHub UI Button Click** 

**Status**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED WORKING** - Traditional method

#### **Process**
1. Navigate to prepared issue in GitHub UI
2. Look for **"Let Copilot work on this"** button
3. Click button to activate agent
4. Agent starts working within minutes

#### **When to Use**
- Manual testing and verification
- One-off activations
- When other methods fail
- Immediate activation needed

### **Method 4: GitHub Copilot Chat Integration**

**Status**: üîç **UNTESTED** - Mentioned in preparation comments

#### **Process**
1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat
2. Mention the specific issue: "Work on issue #[number]"
3. Agent should pick up the context and start working

#### **When to Use**
- Interactive development sessions
- Complex guidance needed
- Troubleshooting activation issues

## üö® Failed/Ineffective Methods

### **‚ùå GitHub API Programmatic Activation**
- **Problem**: No API endpoint exists to trigger "Let Copilot work on this"
- **Evidence**: Confirmed in `CODING-AGENT-ARCHITECTURE-ANALYSIS.md`
- **Workaround**: Use comment-based activation instead

### **‚ùå Issue Assignment to Copilot User**
- **Problem**: Dashboard shows "Open RFCs assigned to Copilot: 0" - no @copilot user exists
- **Evidence**: Copilot assignee detected as `<not found>` in dashboard
- **Workaround**: Use labels and comments instead of assignments

## üîß Automation Integration

### **Current Workflow Enhancement (UPDATED APPROACH)**

The existing `.github/workflows/auto-spawn-copilot-agents.yml` should be enhanced to include `@copilot` mentions in issue bodies rather than comments:

#### **‚ùå Old Approach (Comments) - Less Reliable**
```yaml
- name: Post activation comment
  run: |
    gh issue comment "$ISSUE_NUMBER" --body "@copilot Hello! This RFC issue has been prepared..."
```

#### **‚úÖ New Approach (Issue Body) - Most Reliable**
```yaml
- name: Create issue with @copilot activation
  run: |
    BODY="This issue tracks implementation of RFC${RFC_NUMBER}.
    
    - RFC document: [${RFC_FILE}](./docs/RFC/${RFC_FILE})
    - Labels: rfc-implementation, agent-work, ai-review-requested
    
    Acceptance Criteria:
    - Satisfy all RFC acceptance criteria  
    - Tests implemented and passing
    - Integrates with existing systems as specified
    
    **@copilot Please implement the RFC${RFC_NUMBER} ${SYSTEM_NAME} as specified in the RFC document. This system handles ${BRIEF_DESCRIPTION}.**"
    
    gh issue create --title "RFC${RFC_NUMBER}: ${TITLE} - Implementation" --body "$BODY" --label "rfc-implementation,agent-work,ai-review-requested"
```

### **Benefits of Body-Based Activation**
- **Most reliable activation** - Proven to create PRs automatically
- **Eliminates manual bottleneck** - No UI clicks or comments needed  
- **Immediate activation** - Agent starts working when issue is created
- **Audit trail** - Issue creation shows when activation occurred
- **Scalable** - Can create multiple issues with activation built-in

## üìä Activation Success Metrics

### **Response Time Expectations**
- **Comment to Action**: 8-15 minutes average
- **Issue to PR Creation**: 15-45 minutes typical
- **PR Updates**: Minutes to hours depending on complexity

### **Success Indicators**
- GitHub Actions workflow runs with "copilot" in name
- New commits on `copilot/*` branches  
- PR creation or updates from `@github-copilot[bot]`
- Issue comments from Copilot acknowledging work

### **Failure Indicators**  
- No GitHub Actions activity after 30+ minutes
- No response comments from Copilot
- Issues remain in "copilot-working" state with no progress

## üéØ Best Practices

### **Effective Activation Comments**
1. **Direct @copilot mention** - Essential for triggering
2. **Clear work request** - "start working on implementing..."  
3. **Context reference** - "as specified in the RFC"
4. **Scope clarity** - Specific system/feature name
5. **Encouraging tone** - "Could you please..." vs demanding

### **Timing Considerations**
- **Batch activations** - Space comments 15-30 seconds apart
- **Avoid overload** - Don't activate >3 agents simultaneously  
- **Monitor capacity** - Check dashboard before activating new work
- **Reactivation threshold** - Wait 24+ hours before reactivating stale work

### **Context Quality**
- **RFC preparation** - Comprehensive acceptance criteria essential
- **Clear boundaries** - Well-defined system interfaces
- **Implementation guidance** - Architecture patterns and conventions
- **Integration points** - How system connects to existing code

## üîÑ Reactivation Strategy

### **When to Reactivate**
- **Stale PRs** - No commits for 24+ hours
- **Incomplete work** - PR exists but has remaining issues
- **Failed builds** - CI/CD failures blocking progress
- **Merge conflicts** - PRs need conflict resolution

### **Reactivation Template**
```markdown
@copilot This [PR/issue] needs attention. Current status:

**Completed**: [list achievements]
**Remaining**: [specific issues to fix]  
**Blockers**: [any specific problems]

Could you please continue and resolve the remaining issues? [specific guidance if needed]
```

## üèÜ Success Stories

### **Dungeon Coding Agent Project - September 1, 2025**
- **Problem**: 3 issues labeled "copilot-working" but zero active agents
- **Root Cause Discovery**: Activation methods have different effectiveness levels
- **Testing Results**: 
  - **Comments on issues**: ‚ùå Failed to create PRs (only triggered labeling workflows)
  - **Comments on PRs**: ‚úÖ Successfully reactivated stale PR #8 
  - **@copilot in issue body**: ‚úÖ **Most reliable** - PR #7 created automatically from Issue #54
- **Solution Applied**: Updated Issues #29, #30, #31 with `@copilot` mentions in bodies
- **Evidence**: Issue #54 ‚Üí PR #7 (Aug 30), PR #8 reactivated via comment (Sep 1)

### **Key Insights**
> **"Different activation methods have vastly different success rates."**

1. **Issue Body @copilot Mentions**: Most reliable for new agent work
2. **PR Comment @copilot Mentions**: Effective for reactivating stale work  
3. **Issue Comment @copilot Mentions**: Triggers workflows but doesn't create PRs
4. **Manual UI Buttons**: Always works but not scalable

The automation system architecture is excellent - the breakthrough was discovering the most reliable activation method.
