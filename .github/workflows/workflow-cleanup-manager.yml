### üìä Failure Analysis
This workflow was automatically disabled due to a high failure rate in recent runs.

### üîß Next Steps
@copilot Please investigate this workflow and either:
1. **Fix the underlying issues** and re-enable by removing \`.disabled\` extension
2. **Remove entirely** if no longer needed
3. **Replace with improved version** if workflow logic needs redesign

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important
The workflow file has been renamed to \`$DISABLED_FILE\` to prevent further failures while maintaining the code for investigation.

**Failed Workflows**: $FAILED_MONITORING

### üîç Common Issues
The new monitoring workflows are failing, likely due to:
1. **Permission Issues**: workflow_run triggers need specific permissions
2. **Fork Limitations**: Schedule triggers don't work in forked repositories  
3. **Configuration Errors**: YAML syntax or API usage issues

### ü§ñ Fix Request
@copilot Please investigate and fix the failing monitoring workflows:

**Tasks**:
1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure workflows have correct permission scopes
2. **Fix Triggers**: Replace schedule with workflow_dispatch if in fork
3. **Test Configuration**: Validate YAML syntax and GitHub API calls
4. **Simplify Logic**: Remove complex features that might be causing failures

**Guidelines**:
- Focus on core functionality over advanced features
- Use proven patterns from working workflows
- Test with minimal viable implementation first
- Add complexity gradually after basic version works

        The Workflow Cleanup Manager has analyzed recent workflow activity and taken automated cleanup actions.
        
        ### ‚úÖ Healthy Workflows
        - Simple Conflict Resolution Agent
        - Auto-Merge Coordination Agent  
        - Setup Automated Merge Environment
        - Create RFC Issues for Copilot
        
        ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Actions Taken
        - Disabled problematic workflows with high failure rates
        - Created issues for manual investigation of complex problems
        - Cleaned up old failed workflow runs to reduce clutter
        - Identified configuration issues in new monitoring workflows
        
        ### üîß Recommended Next Steps
        1. **Review Disabled Workflows**: Check issues created for disabled workflows
        2. **Fix Monitoring Workflows**: Address configuration issues in new monitoring features
        3. **Test Improvements**: Validate fixes before re-enabling workflows
        4. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for improvement in workflow success rates
        
        ### üìã Maintenance Schedule
        This cleanup runs daily to maintain workflow health and prevent accumulation of failed runs.
