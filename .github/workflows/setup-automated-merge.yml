name: Setup Automated Merge Environment

# Note:
# - This workflow is informational and posts a setup summary.
# - It does NOT toggle repository settings.
# - Use `enable-auto-merge.yml` for actual repo setting changes (allow_auto_merge, delete_branch_on_merge).

# Sets up the repository for fully automated agent-to-agent workflow
# No human intervention required after initial setup

        ## ðŸŽ‰ Automated Agent Workflow Setup Complete!
        
        ### âœ… Configured Settings:
        - **Auto-merge**: Enabled for agent PRs
        - **Branch protection**: Requires status checks but no human approval
        - **Merge strategy**: Squash merge only (clean history)
        - **Branch cleanup**: Automatic deletion after merge
        
        ### ðŸ¤– Agent Workflow:
        1. **Implementation Agent** (Copilot) creates feature branch & implements RFC
        2. **Implementation Agent** opens pull request
        3. **Coordination Agent** automatically reviews PR:
           - âœ… Builds successfully
           - âœ… Tests pass
           - âœ… RFC completion verified (>80%)
           - âœ… Code quality check (>70/100)
        4. **Coordination Agent** auto-merges if all criteria met
        5. **Coordination Agent** closes RFC issue and posts completion status
        
        ### ðŸš€ Ready for Fully Automated Development!
        
        **Next Steps**:
        1. Create RFC issues (use workflow or script)
        2. Assign issues to @copilot
        3. Watch agents work autonomously!
        
        No human intervention required - agents handle everything from implementation to integration.
