# RFC008: Save Game Data System

## ðŸ“‹ Metadata
- **RFC Number**: 008
- **Title**: Save Game Data System
- **Status**: âœ… Complete
- **Author**: System Architect
- **Created**: 2025-08-30
- **Dependencies**: RFC001 (Core Game Loop)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Implement basic save/load functionality that persists player progress, map state, and game session to JSON files.

## ðŸ“– Problem Statement

Players need to save their progress and continue playing later. The system should save player stats, inventory, current map, and position.

## âœ… Definition of Done

### **Required Data Structures**
- [x] `GameSaveData` class with Player stats, Inventory items, MapData, CurrentPosition
- [x] `MapSaveData` class with Width, Height, TileData array, EntityPositions
- [x] `PlayerSaveData` class with Name, Level, Health, Mana, Experience, Stats

### **Required Functionality**
- [x] Ctrl+S saves game to `saves/quicksave.json`
- [x] Ctrl+L loads game from `saves/quicksave.json`  
- [x] Save includes: all player data, current map layout, item positions, current turn
- [x] Load restores: player state, map, entities, game turn counter

### **File Management**
- [x] Creates `saves/` directory if it doesn't exist
- [x] Uses JSON serialization for human-readable save files
- [x] Handles file I/O errors gracefully (shows error messages)
- [x] Validates save file format before loading

### **Success Criteria**
- [x] Save game, close program, restart, load game - identical state restored
- [x] Player position, health, mana, inventory preserved exactly
- [x] Map layout and all items in same positions
- [x] Save/load operations complete in <1 second
- [x] Clear feedback: "Game saved" / "Game loaded" messages

### **Error Handling**
- [x] Cannot save during combat or menu screens
- [x] File permission errors show helpful messages  
- [x] Corrupted save files detected and reported
- [x] Missing save file shows "No save file found"

### **Technical Requirements**
- [x] Uses System.Text.Json for serialization
- [x] Save files stored in user documents or game directory
- [x] Atomic save operations (temp file + rename to prevent corruption)

## ðŸ”— Integration Points

**Dependencies**: All game components must be serializable
**Events Published**: GameSaved, GameLoaded
**Events Consumed**: SaveRequested, LoadRequested

**Estimated Effort**: 2 days
**Risk Level**: Medium - File I/O and serialization complexity
**Priority**: Medium - Important for player experience
