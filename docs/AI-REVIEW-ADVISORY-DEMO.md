# AI Review Advisory Demo

This file exists to open a small PR and demonstrate that the Gemini AI review is advisory-only and does not block merges.

Expected behavior after merge of PR #66:
- The AI review checks post advisory notes when the `ai-review` label is missing.
- Merges are not blocked by the absence of the label.
