## 🔍 How to Monitor Progress

### **Daily Quick Check**
```bash
# View live dashboard
gh issue view 22

# Check active Copilot agents
gh issue list --label "copilot-working" --state open

# See PRs ready for review
gh pr list --state open --label "ai-review-requested"
```

### **Weekly Progress Review**
```bash
# Trigger manual status update
gh workflow run status-dashboard.yml

# Check RFC reconciliation
gh workflow list | grep reconcile

# Review completed work
gh pr list --state merged | grep RFC
```

## 📈 Progress Trends

Your system shows **healthy continuous progress**:

### **Implementation Pipeline Flow**

## 💡 Recommendations

Your system is already comprehensive! Here's how to maximize its effectiveness:

### **Daily Habits**
1. **Check Dashboard**: Visit Issue #22 for quick progress overview
2. **Review Stale Work**: Look for issues/PRs with no recent updates
3. **Monitor Capacity**: Ensure 3 Copilot agents are actively working

### **Weekly Reviews**
1. **Merge Ready PRs**: Promptly merge completed work to free up capacity
2. **Assign New Work**: Add `agent-assigned` labels to ready issues
3. **Update Priorities**: Reorder RFCs based on project needs

### **As Needed**
1. **Add Bypass Labels**: Use `experimental-workflow` for quick iterations
2. **Manual Triggers**: Run workflows manually when needed
3. **Create New RFCs**: System will auto-detect and create issues

## 🏆 Conclusion

**Your RFC monitoring system is exemplary!** You have:

- ✅ **Automated progress tracking** with real-time dashboard
- ✅ **Capacity-managed workflow** preventing overload
- ✅ **Complete lifecycle automation** from RFC to completion
- ✅ **Quality assurance** with AI review integration
- ✅ **Flexible bypass mechanisms** for rapid development
- ✅ **Comprehensive metrics** for data-driven decisions

The system is actively ensuring your RFCs are being **gradually implemented** (3 in progress), **merged** (1 completed, 7 PRs open), **closed** (automatic on merge), and **created** (auto-detection of new RFCs).

**You can trust that your RFC ecosystem is being systematically advanced toward completion!** 🚀
